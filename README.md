# Hybrid-Models-for-both-spatial-and-temporal-feature-extraction-in-video-segmentation
Hybrid models combine multiple neural network architectures to tackle complex tasks. 
- Semantic Segmentation Using ViTs
- Vehicle Spatial-UNet Segmentation
- a hybrid of CNNs and RNNs can be used for both spatial and temporal feature extraction in video segmentation
- longitudinal medical imaging tasks.
